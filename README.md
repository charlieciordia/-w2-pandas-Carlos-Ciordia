## Goal 🚀

This repository shows a data cleansing project using different methods, as well as the visualisation of results. 

The theme is "Shark Attacks" and the data has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)


## Structure 📂

The repository is divided into several folders containing the following files:

- **Folder src:**

   - **attacks**: raw dataset.
   - **clean_shark.csv**: dataset after cleaning.

- **Folder notebook:**

   - **main.ipynb**: in this file all the work is done.
   - **Limpieza de datos.ipynb**: in this file the cleaning methods are applied. The functions that are applied are obtained from the file.
   - **Visualización .ipynb**: in this file data is visualized by means of graphics, using seaborn. 

- **Folder img:**
   - the folder to save memes and graphs from the data analysis.


## Let's do this 🎣

**1. Three objectives:**

**O1:** Death ratio depending on the activity.

**O2:** Percentage distribution of attack type by gender

**O3:** US Sharks attacks by activity and area


**2.Explore and clean data**

**3.Data visualization and conlusions**

 O1:  It is unlikely to die if you are attacked by a shark.
